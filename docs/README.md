## Team Retrospective Analysis

During this project, the most significant technical challenge we faced was managing multiple branches and synchronizing our local work with the remote repository. Coordinating development among team members required constant attention to avoid conflicts and maintain a stable main branch. The differences in local environments and file structures caused occasional mismatches, which had to be resolved carefully to prevent overwriting critical changes.

A specific merge conflict occurred when integrating the `develop` branch into `main`. Conflicts arose in files including `index.html` and `profile.css` because different team members had modified the same sections independently. To resolve this, we followed these steps:
1. Identified conflicting files using `git status`.
2. Opened each file to manually review conflicting sections marked by Git.
3. Decided which changes to keep and edited the files accordingly.
4. Marked the conflicts as resolved using `git add`.
5. Completed the merge with `git commit`, ensuring the main branch contained all intended updates.

The pull request and peer review process was highly effective in improving the final quality. Each submission was reviewed by at least one other team member, allowing us to catch errors, improve code readability, and ensure consistency across the project. Feedback on styling, naming conventions, and HTML structure helped maintain a professional and uniform appearance throughout. The process encouraged collaboration and accountability, resulting in a polished final product ready for deployment.

Overall, the project highlighted the importance of communication, disciplined use of Git workflows, and structured peer review in a collaborative software development environment.
